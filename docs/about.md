I am a PhD candidate at University at Buffalo. My research is on applied algorithms and data structures for managing massive volumes of data in resource constrained environments, particularly in the context of problems with applications to areas of scientific computing such as computational biology.

<!-- My primary goals are both to design new algorithms that can be implemented efficiently in practice and to develop theoretical models that capture the aspects of data intensive problems important to system designers. Currently, my focus is on edge computing for mobile DNA analytics. -->
